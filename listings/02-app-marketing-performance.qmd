### Overview

This project focused on improving engagement and download rates for the CPP Mobile student services app. I worked on persona-driven feature development, A/B testing for app layout, and a series of targeted campaigns (email, text, website, and social media) to increase downloads and re-engagement.

We analyzed campaign KPIs across multiple channels and optimized both content and delivery methods. The strategy was built on real student demographic data and tailored to the behavioral patterns of Cal Poly Pomona's student body.
