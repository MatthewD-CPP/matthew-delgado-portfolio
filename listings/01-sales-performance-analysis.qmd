### Overview

This project focused on analyzing unit and dollar sales for Nerds-branded candy across different retail channels using IRI scanner data. The analysis covered weekly performance, YOY changes, pricing strategies, and market share trends.

By comparing distribution (ACV), average pricing, and promotional pricing across SKUs and geographies, I identified growth opportunities and underperforming segments to inform merchandising and marketing strategy.
