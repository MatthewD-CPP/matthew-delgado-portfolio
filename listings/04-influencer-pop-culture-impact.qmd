### Overview

This project explored how influencer marketing and popular culture shape consumer decisions, brand perception, and economic behavior. Through research on real-world trends, platform growth, and industry examples, I analyzed both the positive impacts (sales, innovation, job creation) and the risks (materialism, scams, lack of regulation) associated with these digital forces.

The paper highlights how trends like FOMO, peer pressure, and celebrity influence can accelerate product adoption — for better or worse — and how marketers must balance trend participation with authenticity and responsibility.
