### Overview

This project analyzed how electric vehicle (EV) brands can align their marketing strategies with the values, behaviors, and preferences of the Millennial generation. Using a mix of secondary data, marketing theory, and psychological frameworks, I evaluated how companies like Tesla tailor their messaging around sustainability, innovation, and affordability to appeal to this influential consumer segment.

The report explores how marketers can apply theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, Diffusion of Innovations, and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to better connect with Millennial consumers in a high-involvement category like EVs.
